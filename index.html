          Kirk Mayes is the CEO of Forgotten Harvest, one of Michigan's top Non-profit organizations and one of the Nation's premiere food rescue organizations.
          Kirk brings passion to his work in the community, and he values his chance to give back as the son of Jamaican parents who immigrated to the United States to create better lives. 
          He attended Brother Rice High School in Birmingham, Mich. and completed his college education at Michigan State University.

          Upon graduation, Kirk worked in a number of “for-impact” organizations driven by a personal mission to improve the educational, social and economic outcomes of the Detroit community. 
          In 2008, Kirk joined National Community Development Institute and The Skillman Foundation's Good Neighborhood initiative in Brightmoor.
          As a result of his service and leadership, Kirk has been received a number of recognitions and awards including being selected to participate in the prestigious Marshall Memorial Fellowship in 2013 and a outstanding Alumni of Michigan State University in 2019.
